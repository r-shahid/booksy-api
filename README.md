# Capstone Project: Booksy


![enter image description here](https://media.giphy.com/media/vKwVYThtQocWA/giphy.gif)

My final project at GA is the lovechild of a Trello board and Goodreads. It's a book tracking app where users can add books they want to read, are reading, and have read. After a book has been completed, users can also add a rating.
